! Majority of this is intented to provide consistent mappings across keyboards
! which otherwise may have different function layer layouts. Also the function
! key is usually on the far right for 60% boards, but I prefer it on the far
! left.

! Windows keys on typical keyboards (make it the function layer key)
keycode 133 = Mode_switch
! HHKB2: left labeled alt/opt key (i swap alt via the dip switch, so make the
! prev alt my function layer key)
keycode 102 = Mode_switch

! Mode_switch + h: Left
! Mode_switch + j: Down
! Mode_switch + k: Up
! Mode_switch + l: Right
! Mode_switch + Backspace: Delete
! Mode_switch + 4: End
! Mode_switch + 0: Home
keycode 43 = h H Left
keycode 44 = j J Down
keycode 45 = k K Up
keycode 46 = l L Right
keycode 22 = BackSpace BackSpace Delete
keycode 13 = 4 dollar End
keycode 19 = 0 parenright Home

! 60% keyboards w/ esc where `~ would be (hhkb2 has an additional key on the
! top row for this, but most 60% boards push those to the function layer, or
! worse push esc to the function layer):
! Mode_switch + ': `
! Mode_switch + \: ~
keycode 48 = apostrophe quotedbl grave
keycode 51 = backslash bar asciitilde

! Standard keyboards, make caps lock the left control
!clear Lock
!clear Control
!keycode 66 = Control_L
!add Control = Control_L Control_R
!! Former Control_L -> Mode_switch
!keycode 37 = Mode_switch
!! Super_L -> Mode_switch
