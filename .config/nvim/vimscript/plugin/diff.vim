" Description: {{{
"   Plugin that provide commands for:
"   - diffing a modified file against the last saved version
"   - navigating changes when using vim's diff mode.
"     - Differs from vim's default [c and ]c bindings in that these commands
"       jump to every change instead of skipping blocks of lines, and also
"       jumps to the changed text column instead of just the line.
