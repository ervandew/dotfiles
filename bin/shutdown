##
# Script to shutdown, reboot, or suspend the OS.
#
#   Usage: shutdown <action>
#     Supported Actions:
#       poweroff:  Power off the machine.
#       reboot:    Reboot the OS.
#       suspend:   Suspend the OS.
#
# This script uses systemctrl to perform the shutdown, reboot, or suspend so
# you can register your own services to perform actions. Here is an example
# where I register a sleep target to lock my screen on suspend:
#
#   $ vim /etc/systemd/system/display-lock.service
#     [Unit]
#     Description=Lock X session
#
#     [Service]
#     User=ervandew
#     Environment=DISPLAY=:0
#     ExecStart=/usr/bin/alock -cursor theme:name=xtr -auth pam
#
#     [Install]
#     WantedBy=sleep.target
#   $ systemctl enable display-lock.service
#
# You can also register scripts to be run before the systemctl command by
# creating a ~/.shutdown.d directory and place your scripts into one of:
#
#   ~/.shutdown.d/shutdown/  Scripts run before poweroff / reboot.
#   ~/.shutdown.d/suspend/   Scripts run before suspend.
#   ~/.shutdown.d/resume/    Scripts run upon resume.
#
# Scripts in these directories will be executed in sorted order as the current
# user.
